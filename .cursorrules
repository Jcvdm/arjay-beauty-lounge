# Arjay Beauty Lounge - Project Intelligence

## Project Overview - Phase 1.1 Complete
ARJAY Beauty Lounge website with mobile-first design, glass morphism aesthetic, and professional client presentation ready for deployment.

## Memory Bank Protocol
- ALWAYS read ALL memory bank files at start of every session
- Memory bank located in `/memory-bank/` directory
- Core files: projectbrief.md, productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md
- Update memory bank when discovering new patterns or after significant changes
- **Current Status**: Phase 1.1 complete, ready for client preview deployment

## Development Preferences - Learned
- **Framework**: Astro v5.9.1 for static generation and performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.1.8 with custom mobile utilities
- **Design**: Mobile-first approach with glass morphism aesthetic
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with 4.5:1+ contrast ratios
- **Deployment**: Netlify for automatic deployment from Git
- **Workflow**: Commit frequently with detailed messages for client tracking

## Critical Implementation Paths - Established
1. **Mobile Navigation**: Always implement visible dropdown with "Menu" and "Book Now" buttons
2. **Glass Morphism**: Use `bg-white/85 backdrop-blur-2xl` for navigation, `bg-white/90` for forms
3. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
4. **Contrast**: Gray-800 text on white/90 backgrounds for perfect legibility
5. **Build Process**: Always resolve Tailwind CSS errors before deployment
6. **Client Preview**: Use detailed commit messages for professional presentation
